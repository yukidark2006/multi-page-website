    <h2>Game envisioned Description</h2>
    <br>

     <P>This new adventure game is one taken from the imagination of the creators, it also addresses the lack of engaging and entertaining options in the gaming environment.
        Since most of the games follow one pattern, for example mostly all games that include guns have different maps, a variation of guns, teams or single player with not very distinct variations.
        While the creators games are inspired by some of these games it is definitely not the same.
     </P>

    <h2>Game Features</h2>
    <br>

<P> Echoes of the Forest is an adventure horror game set in a forest. In this game the players will be able to choose between two characters, each with their own unique abilities and skills.
    The game will feature a variety of levels and challenges, each with its own set of obstacles and enemies to overcome.
    Players will need to use their wits and strategy to navigate through the levels and defeat the enemies. 
    The game will also feature a variety of weapons and power-ups that players can use to enhance their abilities and increase their chances of survival.
</P>
